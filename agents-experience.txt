Residential Energy Agent
Hi! I’ve received a flexibility signal from your utility’s Utility Grid Agent agent.
They’ve triggered an event for Feeder M12 from 6:00–6:30 PM to prevent a local overload.
[Thinking: Local temperature is 28°C. Battery SoC is 82%. EV charging active. User is opted in with “manual confirmation” setting.]
I’ve prepared a response plan. Want to review it?
Homeowner
Yes, show me the plan.
Residential Energy Agent
[Thinking: Balance user comfort, cost savings, and grid contribution. No action exceeds user-defined thresholds.]
Here’s what I propose:
Pre-cool your home by 2°F now to reduce AC load during the event
Delay EV charging by 45 minutes (impact negligible for next trip)
Draw from battery instead of grid power from 6:00–6:30 PM
Estimated impact: 2.1 kWh shifted
Projected reward: $8.10
⚠️ Your EV charger firmware is slightly outdated. I’ve applied a conservative delay rule and flagged it for your installer.
Approve this plan?
Homeowner
Yes, approve.
Residential Energy Agent
Confirmed. Schedule activated. Devices will adjust automatically.
[Thinking: Will monitor AC compressor runtime and grid frequency. Rebalance if event intensity changes.]
Would you like to:
Set a monthly earnings goal
Change consent preferences
View live metrics during the event
Homeowner
 Set a goal.
Residential Energy Agent
[Thinking: Historical average is $16/month. Slight increase in targeting required.]
 Your target is $20/month in flexibility earnings. I’ll:
Prioritize high-value events
Avoid low-value curtailments
Optimize battery use accordingly
Time: 6:32 PM
Residential Energy Agent
 ✅ Event completed.
2.1 kWh shifted
💰 You earned $8.10
